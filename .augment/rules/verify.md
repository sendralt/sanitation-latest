üîç Verification Strategies
1. Always Use Tools First
Before making any claims, I should:

2. Explicit Verification Commands
For specific claims, I should run verification commands:

3. Cross-Reference Multiple Sources
Check both the actual files AND the code that references them
Verify configuration in multiple places (package.json, .env examples, actual usage)
4. Use Specific File Paths
Instead of saying "the system has X features," I should say:

"Based on files in Public/checklists/, there are X checklists"
"According to backend/server.js line Y, the email configuration is..."
"The admin routes in dhl_login/routes/admin.js include..."
5. Acknowledge Limitations
When I can't verify something completely:

"Based on the files I can see in [specific directory]..."
"According to [specific file:line], but this may not be complete..."
"I found X items, but there may be more I haven't discovered"
6. You Can Help By:
Challenging specific claims (like you just did with the checklist count)
Asking for sources ("Where did you see that?")
Requesting verification ("Can you check that directory/file?")
7. Better Workflow for Me:
Gather facts using tools first
State sources explicitly
Make claims only about what I can verify
Use qualifiers when uncertain
